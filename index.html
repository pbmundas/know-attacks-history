                        <p>This web application is an invaluable resource for cybersecurity enthusiasts seeking to deepen their understanding of historical cyber attacks, such as famous attack stuxnet in 2010, by mapping them to MITRE ATT&CK tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). It provides a technical breakdown of what happened, where vulnerabilities were exploited, and how threat actors executed their campaigns, from initial access to exfiltration.</p>
                        <p>Through an interactive flowchart, users can explore the attack flow, visualize the sequence of techniques, and dive into detailed metadata, including indicators of compromise (IOCs) and affected assets. As the application grows with more attack scenarios, it offers a dynamic platform for learning the start-to-end progression of cyber threats, enabling enthusiasts to analyze TTPs, understand adversary behavior, and enhance their defensive strategies.</p>
                        <p>Note: This is based on gathered information and data might not be accurrate but this is just to help people who are interested to learn real-world attack patterns.</p>
